# Habari, Dunia! (Hello, World!)ðŸ‘‹

I am January Thomas(Janvier), I have high Interest in IoT and Embedding Software Design. I'm Aspiring Data Scientist, A Researcher in Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
I'm open minded on any discussion about Advanced Programming.

### My Open Research and Proof of Concept
   # 1. AWS IoT Core (Kotlin, AppSync)
 ## What I did?
 Used Raspberry Pi, ESPerrif as embedded devices that communicate direct with AWS IoT core by MQTT and simple devices shadows to store commands states from Android Application to monitor and control the IoT, What else I used (DynamoDB, Lambda + Google FCM, SNS)
 [Android Application]()
 [ESP Firmware]()
 [Raspberry pi]()
   # 2. Credit Score (LSTM)
  I wanted to forecast future customers growth using LSTM implemented with Pytorch
   # 3. Plant Diseases Image Classfication
  
  
  
### Superpowers
I have bigger Ears than tounge, I prefer to listen and speak less, I always found in places where there is few on people.
I always learn anything useful.
